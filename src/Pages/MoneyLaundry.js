                  Institute of Global Peace and Conflict Management, Nigeria, a
                  not for profit institution, recognizes the importance of
                  preventing money laundering and terrorism financing and is
                  committed to the highest standards of Anti-Money Laundering
                  and Combating Terrorist Financing in Nigeria.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Institute, as a designated non-financial institution
                  (DNFI), is subject to applicable legislation designed to
                  prevent Money Laundering. This legislation includes: Terrorism
                  Prevention Act2103, Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 (as
                  amended) and others.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To fulfil this commitment, The Institute has established
                  internal policies and procedures. This Policy establishes
                  standards which every employee, donor and business partner of

                <h5>1.1 Scope</h5>
                <p>
                  Money Laundering is the process of any activity by which
                  criminally obtained money or other assets (criminal property)
                  are exchanged for “clean” money or other assets with no
                  obvious link to their criminal origins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Criminal proceeds may take any form, including money or
                  money’s worth, securities, tangible property and intangible
                  property. Terrorism Financing is defined as providing,
                  depositing, distributing or collection funds, directly or
                  indirectly, intended to be used, or knowing that these funds
                  are to be wholly or partially use, for the committing of
                  terrorist acts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This Policy is aimed to prevent any organization or individual
                  from using the Institute for money laundering or terrorist
                  financing activities.

                <h5>1.2 Our Policy</h5>

                <strong>Customer Due Diligence</strong>
                <p>
                  To prevent Money Laundering, Institute will implement
                  processes and procedures in its Line of Businesses (LOBs) to
                  conduct appropriate customer due diligence through the
                  Institute partner Screening Questionnaire, trainees or
                  membership application form, identifying the customer and
                  verifying the customer’s identity on the basis of the
                  following “Know Your Customer” principles:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Customer provided documentation (Verification Checking);
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Information on the customer obtained from reliable and
                    independent sources (Ownership Checking);
                  </li>
                  <li>Compliance with the Institute Code of Conducts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Unusual activity during the customer due diligence process or
                  customer engagement should be reported immediately to the
                  designated person.

                <h5>1.3 Risk-Based Approach</h5>
                <p>
                  For Institute, the threat of being involved in money
                  laundering and terrorist financing activities is low but
                  however if any, may depends directly on the type of business
                  the institute donors or clients carryout or on the country
                  where they are located.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Institute will classify its customers based on a risk
                  level in its applicable line of business processes and
                  procedures. Identifying the potential risk will help to
                  effectively manage these risks, implementing controls to
                  mitigate the identified risk, if any.

                  Customer documentation can either be submitted in physical or
                  electronic form. An appropriate record of the received
                  documentation, steps taken and copies of, or reference to, the
                  documentation of the customer must be kept.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Records should be kept for as long as the relationship endures
                  with the customer and for at least five (5) years after the
                  relationship ends. In countries where this period exceeds the
                  established period of time, the legally established time
                  period will be considered to comply with local law.

                  partner becomes aware of any suspicion or knowledge of
                  possible Money Laundering activity, this is reported without

                  directly the AMLO or any Director available.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A report on suspicious activity should contain, at least, the
                  following information, which will be confirmed by the AMLO:
                </p>

                  The AMLO may make reasonable enquiries within the Institute to
                  confirm these suspicions or obtain additional information to
                  confirm these suspicions. After this assessment, the AMLO will
                  determine whether or not it is necessary to file an official
                  report to the responsible money laundering authority.
                </p>

                <p>
