              <h3>THE NEED</h3>
              <p>
                Dr. Pst. Paul Enenche said,{" "}
                <b>“Peace is the universal craving of all humans”</b>. This
                statement is truer now than ever. It is in the nature of humans
                that where people lives, works and co-exists, there could be
                differences in opinions, interests, views and perceptions. In a
                situation like this, conflict is inevitable. Conflict if not
                early identify and properly manage, can degenerate into crisis
                and escalate into full wars.{" "}
              </p>

              <p>
                In Nigeria, we have witnessed and are still witnessing different
                destructive dimensions of conflicts, ranging from religious to
                political conflicts, communal to ethnic conflicts,
                herders-farmers conflict, conflicts over economic and resource
                control, social conflicts, employers-employees conflicts among
                others.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our history as a people, peace building efforts have been
                impacted negatively by the footprints of geopolitics,
                marginalization, secessionist drives, economic exclusions,
                identity-based discrimination such as religion, race, caste,
                ethnicity and tribalism, gender, sexual orientation and language
                differences.
              </p>

              <p>
                We are all aware of high level injustices, inequalities,
                nepotism, sectionalism and tribal hatred in our political,
                educational, economic and social institutions both public and
                private, breeding serious structural and other forms of
                conflict.
              </p>

              <p>
                At global stage, dangerous and devastating conflicts are ongoing
                in almost all the continents of the world, thereby, endangering
                the global ecosystem. At organizational levels, many
                corporations have been sold-out or shut down largely to
                conflicting interest and leadership crisis.
              </p>
              <p>
                With these continually on the rise, without appropriate
                preventive measures and skills to curtail conflicts and
                conflicting situations, peace cannot be achieved for sustainable
                development. No meaningful development can ever be achieved
                without reasonable peace. The need to create a sustainable
                peaceful environment, for people to live together, work and
                co-exist to achieve their goals, becomes paramount.
              </p>

              <p>
                The need to raise and develop a great number of peace builders
                around the globe to attend to matters of peace building,
                developmental initiatives and conflict prevention and management
                to achieve total transformation, requires deliberate and
                conscious efforts.
              </p>

              <p>
                Going by the above, the INSTITUTE OF GLOBAL PEACE AND CONFLICT
                MANAGEMENT is incorporated, as a global partner in the pursuit
                of peace and as a think-tank to promote research, enhance human
                capacity building, intervenes and mediates, advance policy
                advocacy, encourage public participation in peace building and
                conflict prevention efforts, sensitize and purge out of the
                public and private institutions issues that create conflicts and
                instill in the next generation, the attitudes of peace and
                tolerance, to create a just and fair society for all.
