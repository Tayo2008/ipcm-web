										Conflict analysis, Prevention, Intervention, Reconciliation
										and Reconstruction (CAPIRR).
									</strong>
									Training In most cases, conflicts are escalated predominantly
									to the inability of conflict handlers to investigate and
									identify the exact causes of a conflict. This incapacitation
									rather create more conflicts in a conflict instead of solving
									it. Many companies have been shut down, communal crisis
									exacerbated, religious crisis aggravated, political parties in
									dilemma, marriages dissolves, friendship disbanded among
									others. All these happens largely to the inability of people
									involved to analyze the disputing situations and arrive at
									appropriate solutions. The goal of this training is to enhance
									the capacity and reshape the mentality of leaders, conflict
									managers and establish the better approach to take in
									determine the cause of conflict, how to prevent it, when to
									intervene, strategies to reconciles and the post-conflicts
									re-building mechanisms.

										Civilian-Military Relations, Security, Violent Extremism and
										Youth Restiveness.
									</strong>
									The relationship between the security apparatus in Nigeria
									with the civilian has been that of suspicion instead of
									cooperation. The relationship has been more of cat and dog. No
									wonder security situations in our nation are difficult to be
									tackled. Because of the cruelty of the military/police,
									community people tends to shield criminal elements in their
									enclaves instead of exposing them to face justice. The fear of
									the police’s wrong sense of judgment, brutality and
									victimization tendencies, people who should be whistleblowers
									tend to withhold information which could have been of used if
									the relationship between the military and the civilian was
									cordial. This training aims to equip the military/police
									architecture with right strategies and approaches to relate
									effectively with the citizenry. This exposure and subsequent
									improvement, violent extremism and youth restiveness can
									adequately be dealt with in a professional manner.

										Democracy, Electoral Violence and Governance{" "}
									</strong>
									In a fragile democracy like ours, electoral violence, vote
									buying, and post-election conflicts are made easy. Governance
									has not been people-oriented. Policy decisions of the
									political leaders favours themselves and not the general
									public. In most cases, campaigns are characterized with
									falsehood and fake promises that follows the politicians into
									governance. The average Nigerians does not believe in the
									political leaders. Decaying internal democratic practices
									among political parties is breeding conflicts of different
									magnitude. These at a whole is creating youth restiveness like
									ENDSARS, insecurity, secession agitations among others. This
									training aimed to bring political players, civic/religious
									leaders, community/traditional leaders, and youth leaders
									together to inundate them with global democratic practices and
									governance principles that promotes peace and enhance conflict
									management in our democratic institutions.
